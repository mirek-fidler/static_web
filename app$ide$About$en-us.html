<p class="S">*******************</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S">The copyright and license notices have been divided in two files:</p>
<p class="S">The notices in COPYING.MinGW-w64.txt (this file) apply only to</p>
<p class="S">MinGW-w64 itself. These don't apply to the binaries built with</p>
<p class="S">MinGW-w64 unless you specifically tell MinGW-w64 to link against</p>
<p class="S">these parts, for example, by enabling profiling code.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S">In addition to the notices in this file, also the notices in</p>
<p class="S">COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt apply to MinGW-w64. Some (possibly</p>
<p class="S">all) notices in that file may apply also to the binaries built with</p>
<p class="S">this version of MinGW-w64. The idea is that if you create binary</p>
<p class="S">packages of your software with MinGW-w64, you can simply copy</p>
<p class="S">COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt into your package to fulfill the</p>
<p class="S">license requirements of the MinGW runtime.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S">If you think that not all notices apply to your package and want to</p>
<p class="S">remove some of them, note that, for example, the gdtoa files always</p>
<p class="S">get linked in if you use any printf-like function. So usually it is</p>
<p class="S">easiest and safest to just keep all the notices.</p>

<p class="S">permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version</p>
<p class="S">3 (&quot;GPLv3&quot;). It applies to a given file (the &quot;Runtime Library&quot;) that</p>
<p class="S">bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that</p>
<p class="S">the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S">When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of</p>
<p class="S">certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled</p>
<p class="S">program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of</p>
<p class="S">non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the</p>
<p class="S">header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S">0. Definitions.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S">A file is an &quot;Independent Module&quot; if it either requires the Runtime</p>
<p class="S">Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an</p>
<p class="S">interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based</p>
<p class="S">on the Runtime Library.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S">&quot;GCC&quot; means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without</p>
<p class="S">modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of</p>
<p class="S">the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any</p>
<p class="S">subsequent versions published by the FSF.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S">&quot;GPL-compatible Software&quot; is software whose conditions of propagation,</p>
<p class="S">modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with</p>
<p class="S">the license of GCC.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S">&quot;Target Code&quot; refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual</p>
<p class="S">target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for</p>
<p class="S">input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution</p>
<p class="S">phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any</p>
<p class="S">format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used</p>
<p class="S">for producing a compiler intermediate representation.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S">The &quot;Compilation Process&quot; transforms code entirely represented in</p>
<p class="S">non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in</p>
<p class="S">Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,</p>
<p class="S">use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered</p>
<p class="S">part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be</p>
<p class="S">understood as starting with the output of the generators or</p>
<p class="S">preprocessors.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S">A Compilation Process is &quot;Eligible&quot; if it is done using GCC, alone or</p>
<p class="S">with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any</p>
<p class="S">work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to</p>
<p class="S">optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an</p>
<p class="S">Eligible Compilation Process.</p>

<p class="S">Copyright (C) 1984-1998 Stephen L. Moshier</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S">It sounds vague, but as to be found at</p>
<p class="S">&lt;http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00295.html&gt;, it gives an</p>
<p class="S">impression that the author could be willing to give an explicit</p>
<p class="S">permission to distribute those files e.g. under a BSD style license. So</p>
<p class="S">probably there is no problem here, although it could be good to get a</p>
<p class="S">permission from the author and then add a license into the Cephes files</p>
<p class="S">in MinGW runtime. At least on follow-up it is marked that debian sees the</p>
<p class="S">version a-like BSD one. As MinGW.org (where those cephes parts are coming</p>
<p class="S">from) distributes them now over 6 years, it should be fine.</p>

<p class="S">these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. &nbsp;Therefore, you have</p>
<p class="S">certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if</p>
<p class="S">you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</p>
<p class="S">gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same</p>
<p class="S">freedoms that you received. &nbsp;You must make sure that they, too, receive</p>
<p class="S">or can get the source code. &nbsp;And you must show them these terms so they</p>
<p class="S">know their rights.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</p>
<p class="S">(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License</p>
<p class="S">giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains</p>
<p class="S">that there is no warranty for this free software. &nbsp;For both users' and</p>
<p class="S">authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</p>
<p class="S">changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to</p>
<p class="S">authors of previous versions.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</p>
<p class="S">modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer</p>
<p class="S">can do so. &nbsp;This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of</p>
<p class="S">protecting users' freedom to change the software. &nbsp;The systematic</p>
<p class="S">pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to</p>
<p class="S">use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. &nbsp;Therefore, we</p>
<p class="S">have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those</p>
<p class="S">products. &nbsp;If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we</p>
<p class="S">stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions</p>
<p class="S">of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</p>
<p class="S">States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of</p>
<p class="S">software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to</p>
<p class="S">avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could</p>
<p class="S">make it effectively proprietary. &nbsp;To prevent this, the GPL assures that</p>
<p class="S">patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</p>
<p class="S">modification follow.</p>

<p class="S"> &nbsp;0. Definitions.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</p>
<p class="S">works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</p>
<p class="S">License. &nbsp;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. &nbsp;&quot;Licensees&quot; and</p>
<p class="S">&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</p>
<p class="S">in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an</p>
<p class="S">exact copy. &nbsp;The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the</p>
<p class="S">earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based</p>
<p class="S">on the Program.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without</p>
<p class="S">permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</p>
<p class="S">infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</p>
<p class="S">computer or modifying a private copy. &nbsp;Propagation includes copying,</p>
<p class="S">distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</p>
<p class="S">public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</p>
<p class="S">parties to make or receive copies. &nbsp;Mere interaction with a user through</p>
<p class="S">a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;</p>
<p class="S">to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</p>
<p class="S">feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</p>
<p class="S">tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</p>
<p class="S">extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</p>
<p class="S">work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. &nbsp;If</p>
<p class="S">the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</p>
<p class="S">menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;1. Source Code.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work</p>
<p class="S">for making modifications to it. &nbsp;&quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source</p>
<p class="S">form of a work.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official</p>
<p class="S">standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</p>
<p class="S">interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</p>
<p class="S">is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other</p>
<p class="S">than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</p>
<p class="S">packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</p>
<p class="S">Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</p>
<p class="S">Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</p>
<p class="S">implementation is available to the public in source code form. &nbsp;A</p>
<p class="S">&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component</p>
<p class="S">(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</p>
<p class="S">(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</p>
<p class="S">produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all</p>
<p class="S">the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</p>
<p class="S">work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</p>
<p class="S">control those activities. &nbsp;However, it does not include the work's</p>
<p class="S">System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</p>
<p class="S">programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</p>
<p class="S">which are not part of the work. &nbsp;For example, Corresponding Source</p>
<p class="S">includes interface definition files associated with source files for</p>
<p class="S">the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</p>
<p class="S">linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</p>
<p class="S">such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</p>
<p class="S">subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</p>
<p class="S">can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding</p>
<p class="S">Source.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</p>
<p class="S">same work.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;2. Basic Permissions.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</p>
<p class="S">copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</p>
<p class="S">conditions are met. &nbsp;This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</p>
<p class="S">permission to run the unmodified Program. &nbsp;The output from running a</p>
<p class="S">covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its</p>
<p class="S">content, constitutes a covered work. &nbsp;This License acknowledges your</p>
<p class="S">rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</p>
<p class="S">convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains</p>
<p class="S">in force. &nbsp;You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose</p>
<p class="S">of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you</p>
<p class="S">with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with</p>
<p class="S">the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do</p>
<p class="S">not control copyright. &nbsp;Those thus making or running the covered works</p>
<p class="S">for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction</p>
<p class="S">and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of</p>
<p class="S">your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under</p>
<p class="S">the conditions stated below. &nbsp;Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10</p>
<p class="S">makes it unnecessary.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</p>
<p class="S">measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</p>
<p class="S">11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</p>
<p class="S">similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such</p>
<p class="S">measures.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</p>
<p class="S">circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention</p>
<p class="S">is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to</p>
<p class="S">the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or</p>
<p class="S">modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's</p>
<p class="S">users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of</p>
<p class="S">technological measures.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you</p>
<p class="S">receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</p>
<p class="S">appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;</p>
<p class="S">keep intact all notices stating that this License and any</p>
<p class="S">non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;</p>
<p class="S">keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all</p>
<p class="S">recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,</p>
<p class="S">and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</p>
<p class="S">produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the</p>
<p class="S">terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it, and giving a relevant date.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released under this License and any conditions added under section</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. &nbsp;This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. &nbsp;This</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regardless of how they are packaged. &nbsp;This License gives no</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work need not make them do so.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</p>
<p class="S">works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,</p>
<p class="S">and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,</p>
<p class="S">in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an</p>
<p class="S">&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not</p>
<p class="S">used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users</p>
<p class="S">beyond what the individual works permit. &nbsp;Inclusion of a covered work</p>
<p class="S">in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other</p>
<p class="S">parts of the aggregate.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</p>
<p class="S">of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the</p>
<p class="S">machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,</p>
<p class="S">in one of these ways:</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;customarily used for software interchange.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. &nbsp;This</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with subsection 6b.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;further charge. &nbsp;You need not require recipients to copy the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source along with the object code. &nbsp;If the place to</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source. &nbsp;Regardless of what server hosts the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charge under subsection 6d.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</p>
<p class="S">from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</p>
<p class="S">included in conveying the object code work.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any</p>
<p class="S">tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,</p>
<p class="S">or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation</p>
<p class="S">into a dwelling. &nbsp;In determining whether a product is a consumer product,</p>
<p class="S">doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. &nbsp;For a particular</p>
<p class="S">product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a</p>
<p class="S">typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status</p>
<p class="S">of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user</p>
<p class="S">actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. &nbsp;A product</p>
<p class="S">is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial</p>
<p class="S">commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent</p>
<p class="S">the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,</p>
<p class="S">procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install</p>
<p class="S">and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from</p>
<p class="S">a modified version of its Corresponding Source. &nbsp;The information must</p>
<p class="S">suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object</p>
<p class="S">code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because</p>
<p class="S">modification has been made.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</p>
<p class="S">specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</p>
<p class="S">part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the</p>
<p class="S">User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a</p>
<p class="S">fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the</p>
<p class="S">Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied</p>
<p class="S">by the Installation Information. &nbsp;But this requirement does not apply</p>
<p class="S">if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install</p>
<p class="S">modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has</p>
<p class="S">been installed in ROM).</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</p>
<p class="S">requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates</p>
<p class="S">for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for</p>
<p class="S">the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. &nbsp;Access to a</p>
<p class="S">network may be denied when the modification itself materially and</p>
<p class="S">adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and</p>
<p class="S">protocols for communication across the network.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</p>
<p class="S">in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly</p>

<p class="S"> &nbsp;7. Additional Terms.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this</p>
<p class="S">License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.</p>
<p class="S">Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</p>
<p class="S">be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent</p>

<p class="S">this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</p>
<p class="S">remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of</p>

<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those licensors and authors.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further</p>
<p class="S">restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10. &nbsp;If the Program as you</p>
<p class="S">received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is</p>
<p class="S">governed by this License along with a term that is a further</p>
<p class="S">restriction, you may remove that term. &nbsp;If a license document contains</p>
<p class="S">a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this</p>
<p class="S">License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms</p>
<p class="S">of that license document, provided that the further restriction does</p>
<p class="S">not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you</p>
<p class="S">must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the</p>
<p class="S">additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating</p>
<p class="S">where to find the applicable terms.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</p>
<p class="S">form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;</p>
<p class="S">the above requirements apply either way.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;8. Termination.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</p>
<p class="S">provided under this License. &nbsp;Any attempt otherwise to propagate or</p>
<p class="S">modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</p>
<p class="S">this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</p>
<p class="S">paragraph of section 11).</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</p>
<p class="S">license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)</p>
<p class="S">provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and</p>
<p class="S">finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright</p>
<p class="S">holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means</p>
<p class="S">prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</p>
<p class="S">reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</p>
<p class="S">violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</p>
<p class="S">received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</p>
<p class="S">copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</p>
<p class="S">your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</p>
<p class="S">licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</p>
<p class="S">this License. &nbsp;If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</p>
<p class="S">reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same</p>
<p class="S">material under section 10.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</p>
<p class="S">run a copy of the Program. &nbsp;Ancillary propagation of a covered work</p>
<p class="S">occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</p>
<p class="S">to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. &nbsp;However,</p>
<p class="S">nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</p>
<p class="S">modify any covered work. &nbsp;These actions infringe copyright if you do</p>
<p class="S">not accept this License. &nbsp;Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</p>
<p class="S">covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</p>
<p class="S">receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and</p>
<p class="S">propagate that work, subject to this License. &nbsp;You are not responsible</p>
<p class="S">for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an</p>
<p class="S">organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</p>
<p class="S">organization, or merging organizations. &nbsp;If propagation of a covered</p>
<p class="S">work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</p>
<p class="S">transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</p>
<p class="S">licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could</p>
<p class="S">give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</p>
<p class="S">Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</p>
<p class="S">the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</p>
<p class="S">rights granted or affirmed under this License. &nbsp;For example, you may</p>
<p class="S">not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</p>
<p class="S">rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</p>
<p class="S">(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</p>
<p class="S">any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for</p>
<p class="S">sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;11. Patents.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</p>
<p class="S">License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. &nbsp;The</p>
<p class="S">work thus licensed is called the contributor's &quot;contributor version&quot;.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims</p>
<p class="S">owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or</p>
<p class="S">hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted</p>
<p class="S">by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,</p>
<p class="S">but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a</p>
<p class="S">consequence of further modification of the contributor version. &nbsp;For</p>
<p class="S">purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant</p>
<p class="S">patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of</p>
<p class="S">this License.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</p>
<p class="S">patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to</p>
<p class="S">make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and</p>
<p class="S">propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express</p>
<p class="S">agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent</p>
<p class="S">(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to</p>
<p class="S">sue for patent infringement). &nbsp;To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a</p>
<p class="S">party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a</p>
<p class="S">patent against the party.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</p>
<p class="S">and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone</p>
<p class="S">to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a</p>
<p class="S">publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,</p>
<p class="S">then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so</p>
<p class="S">available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the</p>
<p class="S">patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner</p>
<p class="S">consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent</p>
<p class="S">license to downstream recipients. &nbsp;&quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have</p>
<p class="S">actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the</p>
<p class="S">covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work</p>
<p class="S">in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that</p>
<p class="S">country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</p>
<p class="S">arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a</p>
<p class="S">covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties</p>
<p class="S">receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</p>
<p class="S">or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</p>
<p class="S">you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</p>
<p class="S">work and works based on it.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within</p>
<p class="S">the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is</p>
<p class="S">conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are</p>
<p class="S">specifically granted under this License. &nbsp;You may not convey a covered</p>
<p class="S">work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is</p>
<p class="S">in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment</p>
<p class="S">to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying</p>
<p class="S">the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the</p>
<p class="S">parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory</p>
<p class="S">patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work</p>
<p class="S">conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily</p>
<p class="S">for and in connection with specific products or compilations that</p>
<p class="S">contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,</p>
<p class="S">or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</p>
<p class="S">any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</p>
<p class="S">otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</p>
<p class="S">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</p>
<p class="S">excuse you from the conditions of this License. &nbsp;If you cannot convey a</p>
<p class="S">covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</p>
<p class="S">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may</p>
<p class="S">not convey it at all. &nbsp;For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you</p>
<p class="S">to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey</p>
<p class="S">the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this</p>
<p class="S">License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have</p>
<p class="S">permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed</p>
<p class="S">under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single</p>
<p class="S">combined work, and to convey the resulting work. &nbsp;The terms of this</p>
<p class="S">License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,</p>
<p class="S">but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,</p>
<p class="S">section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the</p>
<p class="S">combination as such.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;14. Revised Versions of this License.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of</p>
<p class="S">the GNU General Public License from time to time. &nbsp;Such new versions will</p>
<p class="S">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</p>
<p class="S">address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Each version is given a distinguishing version number. &nbsp;If the</p>
<p class="S">Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General</p>
<p class="S">Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the</p>
<p class="S">option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered</p>
<p class="S">version or of any later version published by the Free Software</p>
<p class="S">Foundation. &nbsp;If the Program does not specify a version number of the</p>
<p class="S">GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published</p>
<p class="S">by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future</p>
<p class="S">versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's</p>
<p class="S">public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you</p>
<p class="S">to choose that version for the Program.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Later license versions may give you additional or different</p>
<p class="S">permissions. &nbsp;However, no additional obligations are imposed on any</p>

<p class="S"> &nbsp;15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</p>
<p class="S">possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</p>
<p class="S">free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;To do so, attach the following notices to the program. &nbsp;It is safest</p>
<p class="S">to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</p>
<p class="S">state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</p>
<p class="S">the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preamble</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for</p>
<p class="S">software and other kinds of works.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</p>
<p class="S">to take away your freedom to share and change the works. &nbsp;By contrast,</p>
<p class="S">the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to</p>
<p class="S">share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free</p>
<p class="S">software for all its users. &nbsp;We, the Free Software Foundation, use the</p>
<p class="S">GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to</p>
<p class="S">any other work released this way by its authors. &nbsp;You can apply it to</p>
<p class="S">your programs, too.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</p>
<p class="S">price. &nbsp;Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</p>
<p class="S">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</p>
<p class="S">them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you</p>
<p class="S">want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new</p>
<p class="S">free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</p>
<p class="S">these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. &nbsp;Therefore, you have</p>
<p class="S">certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if</p>
<p class="S">you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</p>
<p class="S">gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same</p>
<p class="S">freedoms that you received. &nbsp;You must make sure that they, too, receive</p>
<p class="S">or can get the source code. &nbsp;And you must show them these terms so they</p>
<p class="S">know their rights.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</p>
<p class="S">(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License</p>
<p class="S">giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains</p>
<p class="S">that there is no warranty for this free software. &nbsp;For both users' and</p>
<p class="S">authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</p>
<p class="S">changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to</p>
<p class="S">authors of previous versions.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</p>
<p class="S">modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer</p>
<p class="S">can do so. &nbsp;This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of</p>
<p class="S">protecting users' freedom to change the software. &nbsp;The systematic</p>
<p class="S">pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to</p>
<p class="S">use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. &nbsp;Therefore, we</p>
<p class="S">have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those</p>
<p class="S">products. &nbsp;If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we</p>
<p class="S">stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions</p>
<p class="S">of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</p>
<p class="S">States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of</p>
<p class="S">software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to</p>
<p class="S">avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could</p>
<p class="S">make it effectively proprietary. &nbsp;To prevent this, the GPL assures that</p>
<p class="S">patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>

<p class="S"> &nbsp;&quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>

<p class="S"> &nbsp;&quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</p>
<p class="S">License. &nbsp;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. &nbsp;&quot;Licensees&quot; and</p>
<p class="S">&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</p>
<p class="S">in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an</p>
<p class="S">exact copy. &nbsp;The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the</p>
<p class="S">earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based</p>
<p class="S">on the Program.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without</p>
<p class="S">permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</p>
<p class="S">infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</p>
<p class="S">computer or modifying a private copy. &nbsp;Propagation includes copying,</p>
<p class="S">distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</p>
<p class="S">public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</p>
<p class="S">parties to make or receive copies. &nbsp;Mere interaction with a user through</p>
<p class="S">a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;</p>
<p class="S">to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</p>
<p class="S">feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</p>
<p class="S">tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</p>
<p class="S">extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</p>
<p class="S">work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. &nbsp;If</p>
<p class="S">the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</p>
<p class="S">menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;1. Source Code.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work</p>
<p class="S">for making modifications to it. &nbsp;&quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source</p>
<p class="S">form of a work.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official</p>
<p class="S">standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</p>
<p class="S">interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</p>
<p class="S">is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other</p>
<p class="S">than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</p>
<p class="S">packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</p>
<p class="S">Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</p>
<p class="S">Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</p>
<p class="S">implementation is available to the public in source code form. &nbsp;A</p>
<p class="S">&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component</p>
<p class="S">(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</p>
<p class="S">(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</p>
<p class="S">produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all</p>
<p class="S">the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</p>
<p class="S">work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</p>
<p class="S">control those activities. &nbsp;However, it does not include the work's</p>
<p class="S">System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</p>
<p class="S">programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</p>
<p class="S">which are not part of the work. &nbsp;For example, Corresponding Source</p>
<p class="S">includes interface definition files associated with source files for</p>
<p class="S">the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</p>
<p class="S">linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</p>
<p class="S">such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</p>
<p class="S">subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</p>
<p class="S">can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding</p>
<p class="S">Source.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</p>
<p class="S">same work.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;2. Basic Permissions.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</p>
<p class="S">copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</p>
<p class="S">conditions are met. &nbsp;This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</p>
<p class="S">permission to run the unmodified Program. &nbsp;The output from running a</p>
<p class="S">covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its</p>
<p class="S">content, constitutes a covered work. &nbsp;This License acknowledges your</p>
<p class="S">rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</p>
<p class="S">convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains</p>
<p class="S">in force. &nbsp;You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose</p>
<p class="S">of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you</p>
<p class="S">with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with</p>
<p class="S">the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do</p>
<p class="S">not control copyright. &nbsp;Those thus making or running the covered works</p>
<p class="S">for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction</p>
<p class="S">and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of</p>
<p class="S">your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under</p>
<p class="S">the conditions stated below. &nbsp;Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10</p>
<p class="S">makes it unnecessary.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</p>
<p class="S">measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</p>
<p class="S">11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</p>
<p class="S">similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such</p>
<p class="S">measures.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</p>
<p class="S">circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention</p>
<p class="S">is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to</p>
<p class="S">the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or</p>
<p class="S">modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's</p>
<p class="S">users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of</p>
<p class="S">technological measures.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you</p>
<p class="S">receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</p>
<p class="S">appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;</p>
<p class="S">keep intact all notices stating that this License and any</p>
<p class="S">non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;</p>
<p class="S">keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all</p>
<p class="S">recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,</p>
<p class="S">and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</p>
<p class="S">produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the</p>
<p class="S">terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it, and giving a relevant date.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released under this License and any conditions added under section</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. &nbsp;This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. &nbsp;This</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regardless of how they are packaged. &nbsp;This License gives no</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work need not make them do so.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</p>
<p class="S">works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,</p>
<p class="S">and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,</p>
<p class="S">in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an</p>
<p class="S">&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not</p>
<p class="S">used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users</p>
<p class="S">beyond what the individual works permit. &nbsp;Inclusion of a covered work</p>
<p class="S">in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other</p>
<p class="S">parts of the aggregate.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</p>
<p class="S">of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the</p>
<p class="S">machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,</p>
<p class="S">in one of these ways:</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;customarily used for software interchange.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. &nbsp;This</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with subsection 6b.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;further charge. &nbsp;You need not require recipients to copy the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source along with the object code. &nbsp;If the place to</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source. &nbsp;Regardless of what server hosts the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charge under subsection 6d.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</p>
<p class="S">from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</p>
<p class="S">included in conveying the object code work.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any</p>
<p class="S">tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,</p>
<p class="S">or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation</p>
<p class="S">into a dwelling. &nbsp;In determining whether a product is a consumer product,</p>
<p class="S">doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. &nbsp;For a particular</p>
<p class="S">product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a</p>
<p class="S">typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status</p>
<p class="S">of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user</p>
<p class="S">actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. &nbsp;A product</p>
<p class="S">is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial</p>
<p class="S">commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent</p>
<p class="S">the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,</p>
<p class="S">procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install</p>
<p class="S">and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from</p>
<p class="S">a modified version of its Corresponding Source. &nbsp;The information must</p>
<p class="S">suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object</p>
<p class="S">code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because</p>
<p class="S">modification has been made.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</p>
<p class="S">specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</p>
<p class="S">part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the</p>
<p class="S">User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a</p>
<p class="S">fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the</p>
<p class="S">Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied</p>
<p class="S">by the Installation Information. &nbsp;But this requirement does not apply</p>
<p class="S">if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install</p>
<p class="S">modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has</p>
<p class="S">been installed in ROM).</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</p>
<p class="S">requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates</p>
<p class="S">for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for</p>
<p class="S">the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. &nbsp;Access to a</p>
<p class="S">network may be denied when the modification itself materially and</p>
<p class="S">adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and</p>
<p class="S">protocols for communication across the network.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</p>
<p class="S">in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly</p>
<p class="S">documented (and with an implementation available to the public in</p>

<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;7. Additional Terms.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this</p>
<p class="S">License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.</p>
<p class="S">Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</p>
<p class="S">be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent</p>

<p class="S">apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately</p>
<p class="S">under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by</p>
<p class="S">this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</p>
<p class="S">remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of</p>
<p class="S">it. &nbsp;(Additional permissions may be written to require their own</p>
<p class="S">removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) &nbsp;You may place</p>

<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or</p>

<p class="S"> &nbsp;Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</p>
<p class="S">form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;</p>
<p class="S">the above requirements apply either way.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;8. Termination.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</p>
<p class="S">provided under this License. &nbsp;Any attempt otherwise to propagate or</p>
<p class="S">modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</p>
<p class="S">this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</p>
<p class="S">paragraph of section 11).</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</p>
<p class="S">license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)</p>
<p class="S">provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and</p>
<p class="S">finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright</p>
<p class="S">holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means</p>
<p class="S">prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</p>
<p class="S">reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</p>
<p class="S">violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</p>
<p class="S">received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</p>
<p class="S">copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</p>
<p class="S">your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</p>
<p class="S">licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</p>
<p class="S">this License. &nbsp;If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</p>
<p class="S">reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same</p>
<p class="S">material under section 10.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</p>
<p class="S">run a copy of the Program. &nbsp;Ancillary propagation of a covered work</p>
<p class="S">occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</p>
<p class="S">to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. &nbsp;However,</p>
<p class="S">nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</p>
<p class="S">modify any covered work. &nbsp;These actions infringe copyright if you do</p>
<p class="S">not accept this License. &nbsp;Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</p>
<p class="S">covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</p>
<p class="S">receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and</p>
<p class="S">propagate that work, subject to this License. &nbsp;You are not responsible</p>
<p class="S">for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an</p>
<p class="S">organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</p>
<p class="S">organization, or merging organizations. &nbsp;If propagation of a covered</p>
<p class="S">work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</p>
<p class="S">transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</p>
<p class="S">licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could</p>
<p class="S">give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</p>
<p class="S">Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</p>
<p class="S">the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</p>
<p class="S">rights granted or affirmed under this License. &nbsp;For example, you may</p>
<p class="S">not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</p>
<p class="S">rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</p>
<p class="S">(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</p>
<p class="S">any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for</p>
<p class="S">sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;11. Patents.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</p>
<p class="S">License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. &nbsp;The</p>
<p class="S">work thus licensed is called the contributor's &quot;contributor version&quot;.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims</p>
<p class="S">owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or</p>
<p class="S">hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted</p>
<p class="S">by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,</p>
<p class="S">but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a</p>
<p class="S">consequence of further modification of the contributor version. &nbsp;For</p>
<p class="S">purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant</p>
<p class="S">patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of</p>
<p class="S">this License.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</p>
<p class="S">patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to</p>
<p class="S">make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and</p>
<p class="S">propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express</p>
<p class="S">agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent</p>
<p class="S">(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to</p>
<p class="S">sue for patent infringement). &nbsp;To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a</p>
<p class="S">party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a</p>
<p class="S">patent against the party.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</p>
<p class="S">and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone</p>
<p class="S">to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a</p>
<p class="S">publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,</p>
<p class="S">then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so</p>
<p class="S">available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the</p>
<p class="S">patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner</p>
<p class="S">consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent</p>
<p class="S">license to downstream recipients. &nbsp;&quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have</p>
<p class="S">actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the</p>
<p class="S">covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work</p>
<p class="S">in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that</p>
<p class="S">country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</p>
<p class="S">arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a</p>
<p class="S">covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties</p>
<p class="S">receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</p>
<p class="S">or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</p>
<p class="S">you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</p>
<p class="S">work and works based on it.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within</p>
<p class="S">the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is</p>
<p class="S">conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are</p>
<p class="S">specifically granted under this License. &nbsp;You may not convey a covered</p>
<p class="S">work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is</p>
<p class="S">in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment</p>
<p class="S">to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying</p>
<p class="S">the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the</p>
<p class="S">parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory</p>
<p class="S">patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work</p>
<p class="S">conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily</p>
<p class="S">for and in connection with specific products or compilations that</p>
<p class="S">contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,</p>
<p class="S">or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</p>
<p class="S">any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</p>
<p class="S">otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</p>
<p class="S">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</p>
<p class="S">excuse you from the conditions of this License. &nbsp;If you cannot convey a</p>
<p class="S">covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</p>
<p class="S">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may</p>
<p class="S">not convey it at all. &nbsp;For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you</p>
<p class="S">to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey</p>
<p class="S">the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this</p>
<p class="S">License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have</p>
<p class="S">permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed</p>
<p class="S">under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single</p>
<p class="S">combined work, and to convey the resulting work. &nbsp;The terms of this</p>
<p class="S">License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,</p>
<p class="S">but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,</p>
<p class="S">section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the</p>
<p class="S">combination as such.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;14. Revised Versions of this License.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of</p>
<p class="S">the GNU General Public License from time to time. &nbsp;Such new versions will</p>
<p class="S">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</p>
<p class="S">address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Each version is given a distinguishing version number. &nbsp;If the</p>
<p class="S">Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General</p>
<p class="S">Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the</p>
<p class="S">option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered</p>
<p class="S">version or of any later version published by the Free Software</p>
<p class="S">Foundation. &nbsp;If the Program does not specify a version number of the</p>
<p class="S">GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published</p>
<p class="S">by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future</p>
<p class="S">versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's</p>
<p class="S">public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you</p>
<p class="S">to choose that version for the Program.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;Later license versions may give you additional or different</p>
<p class="S">permissions. &nbsp;However, no additional obligations are imposed on any</p>
<p class="S">author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a</p>
<p class="S">later version.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY</p>

<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</p>
<p class="S">possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</p>
<p class="S">free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;To do so, attach the following notices to the program. &nbsp;It is safest</p>
<p class="S">to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</p>
<p class="S">state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</p>
<p class="S">the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<p class="S">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="S"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</p>

<p class="S">Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
